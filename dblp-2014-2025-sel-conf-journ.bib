	abstract = {Phishing attacks attempt to deceive users into stealing sensitive information, posing a significant cybersecurity threat. Advances in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have led to the development of numerous phishing webpage detection solutions, but these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Evaluating their robustness against adversarial phishing webpages is essential. Existing tools contain datasets of pre-designed phishing webpages for a limited number of brands, and lack diversity in phishing features. To address these challenges, we develop PhishOracle, a tool that generates adversarial phishing webpages by embedding diverse phishing features into legitimate webpages. We evaluate the robustness of two existing models, Stack model and Phishpedia, in classifying PhishOracle-generated adversarial phishing webpages. Additionally, we study a commercial large language model, Gemini Pro Vision, in the context of adversarial attacks. We conduct a user study to determine whether PhishOracle-generated adversarial phishing webpages deceive users. Our findings reveal that many PhishOracle-generated phishing webpages evade current phishing webpage detection models and deceive users, but Gemini Pro Vision is robust to the attack. We also develop the PhishOracle web app, allowing users to input a legitimate URL, select relevant phishing features and generate a corresponding phishing webpage. All resources are publicly available on GitHub.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05941},
	abstract = {To address the challenging problem of detecting phishing webpages, researchers have developed numerous solutions, in particular those based on machine learning (ML) algorithms. Among these, brand-based phishing detection that uses models from Computer Vision to detect if a given webpage is imitating a well-known brand has received widespread attention. However, such models are costly and difficult to maintain, as they need to be retrained with labeled dataset that has to be regularly and continuously collected. Besides, they also need to maintain a good reference list of well-known websites and related meta-data for effective performance. In this work, we take steps to study the efficacy of large language models (LLMs), in particular the multimodal LLMs, in detecting phishing webpages. Given that the LLMs are pretrained on a large corpus of data, we aim to make use of their understanding of different aspects of a webpage (logo, theme, favicon, etc.) to identify the brand of a given webpage and compare the identified brand with the domain name in the URL to detect a phishing attack. We propose a two-phase system employing LLMs in both phases: the first phase focuses on brand identification, while the second verifies the domain. We carry out comprehensive evaluations on a newly collected dataset. Our experiments show that the LLM-based system achieves a high detection rate at high precision; importantly, it also provides interpretable evidence for the decisions. Our system also performs significantly better than a state-of-the-art brand-based phishing detection system while demonstrating robustness against two known adversarial attacks.},

	abstract = {There has been ever-growing use of Internet and progress within many communication channels such as social media and this escalates the need for rapid and low source demanding phishing detection mechanisms. In this very study, we propose a new deep neural model for phishing URL identiﬁcation so-called GramBeddings introducing some distinguishing novelties by (1) proposing the use of n-gram embeddings, computed on the ﬂy, requiring no pre-training stage, (2) removing the necessity of word and sub-word level information, (3) providing a smart and eﬃcient n-gram selection pipeline, and beneﬁting from attention mechanism. Other than that, we share a publicly available, large-scale and novel dataset2 including 800K real-world phishing and legitimate URLs. Our scheme suggests an adjustable and automated n-gram selection and ﬁltering mechanism along with a new neural network architecture concatenating four-channel information ﬂow through cascading CNN, LSTM, and attention layers. With that, discriminative multi-level character patterns can be discovered without any hand-crafted operation and are enabled to contribute to prediction. As a result, the proposed system provides the following features in the problem domain: (i) real-time, end-to-end and high performance inference, (ii) language-agnostic prediction, and (iii) removal of the necessity of any third-party service or hand-crafted feature. These experiments show that our approach outperforms the other models in the literature with an accuracy of 98.27\%. Moreover, the comparative study conducted with several datasets clearly veriﬁes the superiority of our model in all tests. We also examine the robustness of our model against a real-world adversarial attack and discuss the methods of overcoming such an attack. Our codebase3 is shared with the community to be used for benchmarking purposes in the future.},

	abstract = {The advanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have made them invaluable across various applications, from conversational agents and content creation to data analysis, research, and innovation. However, their effectiveness and accessibility also render them susceptible to abuse for generating malicious content, including phishing attacks. This study explores the potential of using four popular commercially available LLMs, i.e., ChatGPT (GPT 3.5 Turbo), GPT 4, Claude, and Bard, to generate functional phishing attacks using a series of malicious prompts. We discover that these LLMs can generate both phishing websites and emails that can convincingly imitate well-known brands and also deploy a range of evasive tactics that are used to elude detection mechanisms employed by anti-phishing systems. These attacks can be generated using unmodified or "vanilla" versions of these LLMs without requiring any prior adversarial exploits such as jailbreaking. We evaluate the performance of the LLMs towards generating these attacks and find that they can also be utilized to create malicious prompts that, in turn, can be fed back to the model to generate phishing scams - thus massively reducing the prompt-engineering effort required by attackers to scale these threats. As a countermeasure, we build a BERT-based automated detection tool that can be used for the early detection of malicious prompts to prevent LLMs from generating phishing content. Our model is transferable across all four commercial LLMs, attaining an average accuracy of 96\% for phishing website prompts and 94\% for phishing email prompts. We also disclose the vulnerabilities to the concerned LLMs, with Google acknowledging it as a severe issue. Our detection model is available for use at Hugging Face, as well as a ChatGPT Actions plugin.},

	abstract = {Phishing was a threat in the cyber world a couple of decades ago and still is today. It has grown and evolved over the years as phishers are getting creative in planning and executing the attacks. Thus, there is a need for a review of the past and current phishing approaches. A systematic, comprehensive and easy-to-follow review of these approaches is presented here. The relevant mediums and vectors of these approaches are identiﬁed for each approach. The medium is the platform which the approaches reside and the vector is the means of propagation utilised by the phisher to deploy the attack. The paper focuses primarily on the detailed discussion of these approaches. The combination of these approaches that the phishers utilised in conducting their phishing attacks is also discussed. This review will give a better understanding of the characteristics of the existing phishing techniques which then acts as a stepping stone to the development of a holistic anti-phishing system. This review creates awareness of these phishing techniques and encourages the practice of phishing prevention among the readers. Furthermore, this review will gear the research direction through the types of phishing, while also allowing the identiﬁcation of areas where the anti-phishing effort is lacking.

	abstract = {Phishing is a cyber-attack that exploits victims’ technical ignorance or naivety and commonly involves a Uniform Resources Locator (URL). As a result, it is beneficial to examine URLs before accessing them to spot a phishing assault. Several algorithms based on machine learning have been presented to detect phishing attempts. However, these approaches often suffer from lower performance outcomes, such as lower accuracy, longer response times, and higher false positive rates. Furthermore, many existing methods rely heavily on predefined feature sets, which may limit their adaptability and robustness. In contrast, our proposed method leverages a more dynamic feature selection process, which includes the Conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (CWGAN) for addressing data imbalance and the Binary Grey Goose Optimization Algorithm (BGGOA) for optimal feature selection. This dynamic approach enhances the model’s ability to adapt to varying data characteristics, improving detection performance. The proposed solution is divided into two stages: pre-deployment and deployment. During the pre-deployment stage, the dataset is preprocessed, including data transformation, handling irrelevant and redundant data, and ensuring data balancing. Minority samples are increased using CWGAN to avoid class imbalance. Features are then selected using BGGOA, resulting in a feature-reduced dataset used for training and testing ensemble deep learning classifiers, specifically the Novel Pyramid Depth-wise Separable-MobileNetV3 (PyDS-MV3) and Deformable Convolutional Residual Neural Network (DCRNN), termed PDSMV3-DCRNN. During the deployment phase, the Boosted ConvNeXt approach extracts URL features fed into the trained classifier to predict "phishing" or "benign". According to experimental findings, the proposed solution outperforms all other tested approaches, displaying a faster training time of 0.11 s and achieving an optimal accuracy of 99.21\%.},

While LLMs have been extensively studied for code generation and text synthesis, their application in detecting malicious web content, particularly phishing sites, remains largely unexplored. To counter the increasing cyber-attacks that leverage LLMs for creating more sophisticated and convincing phishing content, it is crucial to automate detection by harnessing LLMs’ advanced capabilities. This paper introduces ChatPhishDetector, a novel system that employs LLMs to identify phishing sites. Our approach involves using a web crawler to collect website information, generating prompts for LLMs based on the gathered data, and extracting detection results from LLM responses. This system enables accurate detection of multilingual phishing sites by identifying impersonated brands and social engineering techniques within the entire website context, without requiring machine learning model training. We evaluated our system’s performance using our own dataset and compared it with baseline systems and several LLMs. Experiments using GPT-4V showed exceptional results, achieving 98.7\% precision and 99.6\% recall, surpassing the detection performance of other LLMs and existing systems. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs for protecting users from online fraudulent activities and provide crucial insights for strengthening defenses against phishing attacks.},

Detecting phishing kits in deployed websites might help to detect phishing campaigns earlier. To the best of our knowledge, there are no datasets providing a set of phishing kits that are used in websites that were attacked by phishing. In this work, we propose PhiKitA, a novel dataset that contains phishing kits and also phishing websites generated using these kits. We have applied MD5 hashes, fingerprints, and graph representation DOM algorithms to obtain baseline results in PhiKitA in three experiments: familiarity analysis of phishing kit samples, phishing website detection and identifying the source of a phishing website. In the familiarity analysis, we find evidence of different types of phishing kits and a small phishing campaign. In the binary classification problem for phishing detection, the graph representation algorithm achieved an accuracy of 92.50\%, showing that the phishing kit data contain useful information to classify phishing. Finally, the MD5 hash representation obtained a 39.54\% F1 score, which means that this algorithm does not extract enough information to distinguish phishing websites and their phishing kit sources properly.},

	abstract = {Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have greatly impacted cybersecurity, particularly in detecting phishing websites. Traditional methods struggle to address evolving vulnerabilities, but research shows that Machine Learning (ML), Ensemble Learning (EL), and Deep Learning (DL) are effective in developing defenses. However, these methods face challenges with adversarial examples (AEs). The multimodal model (MM) is a promising solution, yet there is a significant lack of research using multimodal techniques specifically for phishing website detection (PWD) against adversarial websites. To tackle this challenge, this paper assesses 15 learning-based models, particularly multimodal ones, for phishing and adversarial detection, aiming to enhance their defense capabilities. Due to the scarcity of adversarial websites, training and testing models are limited. Therefore, this study proposes an innovative attack framework, AWG - Adversarial Website Generation that employs Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and transfer-based black box attacks to create AEs. This framework closely mirrors real-world attack scenarios, ensuring high effectiveness and realism. Finally, we present defense strategies with straightforward implementation and high effectiveness to enhance the resistance of models. The models underwent training and testing on a dataset collected from reputable sources such as OpenPhish, PhishTank, Phishing Database, and Alexa. This approach was chosen to ensure the dataset’s diversity and relevance to reflect real-world conditions. Experimental results highlight that the Generator’s effectiveness is demonstrated by a domain structure generation rate exceeding 90\%. Moreover, AEs generated by this Generator effectively bypass most state-of-the-art ML, DL, and EL models with an evasion rate of up to 88\%. Notably, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is the most vulnerable, with a detection rate of only 10.02\%. On the other hand, the MM Shark-Eyes demonstrates outstanding resistance against AEs, with a detection rate of up to 99\%. Upon applying our defense strategy, the resistance of models is significantly boosted, with all detection rates surpassing 90\%. These findings underscore the robustness of our methods and pave the way for further exploration into advanced attack and defense strategies in the context of phishing and adversarial website detection.},

Unlike previous work in this ﬁeld, we train the classiﬁer on a noisy dataset consisting of millions of samples from previously collected live classiﬁcation data.

The escalation in dependency upon the internet for meeting daily chores has made them vulnerable to falling prey to the ever-evolving menace of phishing. The objective of this article is: to explore different tactics and motivational factors behind phishing, identify the communication mediums through which phishing is circulated and perform a detailed review along with a comparison of the various surveys in this domain. Another objective is to determine the open research challenges in this genre and to identify the scope of research in the future. An extensive literature survey is performed, which includes articles from eminent online research databases. Barring a few initial articles related to phishing, the articles published in Science Citation/Scopus-indexed journals and survey/review articles published in the last ten years are considered. Highly cited works are given preference. The search query returned numerous articles, which were narrowed by title screening. Further screening of articles was performed by reading the abstract and eliminating the articles related to user-oriented phishing interventions. Eventually, 25 survey articles were shortlisted to be surveyed. This article is an effort to provide a novel taxonomy of phishing to academia that would assist in identifying the sections where phishing countermeasures are inadequate.},

@article{zhang_highly_nodate,
	title = {Highly {Predictive} {Blacklisting}},
	abstract = {The notion of blacklisting communication sources has been a well-established defensive measure since the origins of the Internet community. In particular, the practice of compiling and sharing lists of the worst offenders of unwanted trafﬁc is a blacklisting strategy that has remained virtually unquestioned over many years. But do the individuals who incorporate such blacklists into their perimeter defenses beneﬁt from the blacklisting contents as much as they could from other list-generation strategies? In this paper, we will argue that there exist better alternative blacklist generation strategies that can produce higher-quality results for an individual network. In particular, we introduce a blacklisting system based on a relevance ranking scheme borrowed from the linkanalysis community. The system produces customized blacklists for individuals who choose to contribute data to a centralized log-sharing infrastructure. The ranking scheme measures how closely related an attack source is to a contributor, using that attacker’s history and the contributor’s recent log production patterns. The blacklisting system also integrates substantive log preﬁltering and a severity metric that captures the degree to which an attacker’s alert patterns match those of common malwarepropagation behavior. Our intent is to yield individualized blacklists that not only produce signiﬁcantly higher hit rates, but that also incorporate source addresses that pose the greatest potential threat. We tested our scheme on a corpus of over 700 million log entries produced from the DShield data center and the result shows that our blacklists not only enhance hit counts but also can proactively incorporate attacker addresses in a timely fashion. An early form of our system have been ﬁelded to DShield contributors over the last year.},
